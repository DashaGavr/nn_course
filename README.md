```model-res``` dir including 2 models: first from finished trainig workflow named ```best-model.h5```,  second in subdir ```best-checkpoint``` is the best by val-accuracy from checkpoint during workflow. 
Dataset and Model implemented  
# Train method:  
_#LBL1_ shuffle training set and split it into train and validation sets (92%/8%)  
_#LBL2_ added checkpoints - saving best by val_accuracy model  
_#LBL3_ trainig process info  
_#LBL4_ showing history
